CompFileDate Build Instructions
===============================

These instructions assume you are building the program using Delphi 2010. Later
versions of Delphi may be suitable with some minor changes to the make file.


Dependencies
------------

The program has no dependencies other than the Delphi VCL.


Build Tools
-----------

The following tools are required to build the program:

+ A Delphi 2010 or later installation. The following tools are required:
  - `DCC32.exe` command line compiler.
  - `BRCC32.exe` resource compiler.
  - `MAKE.exe` the Borland / Embarcaero make utility (other make tools will not
     suffice). The following instructions assume that `MAKE` is on the system
     path. If not you must specify the correct path when running `MAKE`
+ `VIEd.exe` (Version Information Editor by DelphiDabbler). See
  http://delphidabbler.com/software/vied.


Environment Variables
---------------------

The program's make file requires that the following environment variables must
be set:

+ `DELPHIROOT` - must be set to the install directory of the version of Delphi
  being used.
+ `DELPHI2010` - may be set to the install directory of Delphi 2010. If set then
  `DELPHIROOT` is ignored.
+ `VIEDINST` - set to the install directory of `VIEd.exe`. If not set then
  `VIEd.exe` is assumed to by on the path.


Download the Source
-------------------

Source code for the current version of DelphiDabbler CompFileDate is always
available from http://www.delphidabbler.com/download?id=compfiledate&type=src
and from the Git repository at
https://sourceforge.net/p/compfiledate/git/ci/master/tree/

To build the program first create a folder and copy the source code from the
download file or from Git into it, preserving the directory structure so that
you have the following:

Build the Program
-----------------

### Command Line

The program is built using the `Makefile` in the `Src` directory.

First configure the source tree by running `Make config`. This adds `Bin`, `Exe`
and `Release` directories in the root.

The program can now be created simply by running `Make` with no parameters.

To create an release run `Make release` after running `Make`. This creates two
zip files, one containing the executable code and the other the source code. The
zip files are placed in the `Release` directory.

### Using the Delphi IDE

The program can be built using the Delphi IDE. Before this can be done you
should run `Make config` followed by `Make resources` to configure the source
tree and create the binary resource files required to build the source.

### Other Build Options

There are other build options available. See the comments in `Makefile` for
details.
